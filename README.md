# Popping in Program (PIP)

Using python (with Beautiful Soup), I compiled a database of ObGyn practices and a database of graduate family and mental counseling programs in 10 different states 

I used the Mapquest API to get the long & lat for every address in these two databases

Lastly, I cross-referenced the two databases by mapping them out using Folium to see which graduate programs were closest to each ObGyn practice location and could enable therapy student volunteers for women post-partum who need support.
